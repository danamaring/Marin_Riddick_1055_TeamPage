I grew up in Luke Skywalker’s house, on a farm with two and a half horses, and in a town with a population number under the view count of most YouTube videos. I attended Humber College for Advertising and Graphic Design and really loved the web design class. They got cut short because of the strike that happened and my colleagues at tbk Creative told me about this program at Fanshawe for web design so I decided to attend that same program. My hobbies include all things design, working out, skiing, and sailing.
