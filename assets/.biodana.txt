I was born in Colima, Mexico which is a very small city where everyone knows each other. I studied a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Education and in the last semester I won a scholarship to study English in Toronto for two months. After I finished my English studies and went back to Colima, I decided that I wanted to study something different related to design and programming in Canada and I found the IDP3 program in Fanshawe and the rest is history. Some of my hobbies are traveling, biking, cooking and of course designing.
